<h2 id="get-startedmisc">Get Started/MISC</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please read this and <code>#readme</code></li>
<li>Tag yourself with relevant roles if someone else hasn’t already (e.g. <code>readme-dev</code>, <code>Caster</code>, <code>Rustaff</code>, etc).</li>
<li>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/Jtkdcc" target="_blank">staff backup server</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GlVQ0fVPDKt0qnJJ4chqGBrrsmhkkZ1YqUxleVcYusg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">qihl Backend Sheet</a> shows Staff Teams and leads, the complete Staff List, Staff Applications, Server Growth, tournament info, and other useful stuff. Do not share the link.</li>
<li>If you’re doing something other than moderating, get on the <a href="https://trello.com/invite/qihl1/0170a55acbb1a742c185aae0010783ae" target="_blank">qihl Trello board</a> so you know what your team is working on. If you’re a dev, everything should be in the gitlab repo.</li>
<li>Do not <code>@staff</code>, <code>@moderators</code>, or similar unless there is a serious reason to do so (staff lobbies, minor player reports, memes, etc are NOT sufficient).</li>
<li>Gold count at the end of a game is basically meaningless to humans as it adds from selling units but does not subtract from buying them.</li>
<li>Enable developer mode in Discord settings under Appearence to right-click people and get their Discord ID. Then you can create <code>@</code>'s yourself (e.g. <code>&lt;@93049613392568320&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="player-reports">Player Reports</h2>
<p>Only those with Staff 2 role have banning rights. If you are Staff, ask a Staff 2 to ban a user for you. Permaban is on the table for multiple offenses, but is evaluated case-by-case.</p>
<h3 id="under-ranked">Under Ranked</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 rank under: Light Warning</li>
<li>2 rank under: Light Warning</li>
<li>3 rank under: Use best judgment. Strong Warning or ban based on the circumstances. If ban, unban if they apologize.</li>
<li>4 rank under: Use best judgment. Strong Warning or ban based on the circumstances. If ban, unban if they apologize.</li>
<li>5+ ranks under: 7 day ban minimum.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="password-sharing">Password Sharing</h3>
<p>Password sharing or inviting friends is often just ignorance to the rules. Most of these are a case-by-case basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve decided they were just ignorant: Give a strong warning and a threat of ban if it happens in the future.</li>
<li>If you’ve decided they were actively trying to get around the rules of the server: 7 day ban minimum.</li>
<li>Ignore if the bot is down.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re unsure, judge based on the rank of the invited player relative to the rest of the lobby. (See Under Ranked rules)</p>
<h3 id="cheating">Cheating</h3>
<p>Make sure, beyond reasonable doubt, they were cheating. Consult with other staff if needed. <code>!blacklist [steamid] [reason]</code> if they are found guilty. Never unban (<code>!unblacklist [steamid]</code>) unless they can PROVE their innocence.</p>
<h3 id="spam">Spam</h3>
<p>If they had a clear intent to flood the server, beyond reasonable doubt, manual Ban to delete their messages with spam as the reason given. If they apologize, unban.</p>
<h3 id="racism-hate-speech-and-personal-attacks">Racism, Hate Speech, and Personal Attacks</h3>

<h2 id="helping-in-help-desk">Helping in <code>#help-desk</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Telling them to read <code>#readme</code> is often the best solution. Maybe mention the specific part.</li>
<li>If someone is having trouble linking, ask them to make sure they are using the correct Discord/Steam in browser. Maybe tell them to clear their browser cache and try again.</li>
<li>If bot says a new persons rank is <code>error</code> check if they have a rank in game. If not, give them the beginner role or tell them to play a few more games until they get a rank.</li>
<li>If bot says someone someones Steam is already linked to another Discord account, ask them to get on that Discord account and post in <code>#help-desk</code>. It’s not a huge deal if they can’t, but it’s preferable. Check if they’ve been banned. If not, <code>!adminunlinksteam [steamid]</code> to unlink from the other Discord account.</li>
<li>Lobbies auto-close after 15 minutes of no activity, 5 minutes of no activity when full, 60 minutes no matter what, or 10 join/leaves.</li>
