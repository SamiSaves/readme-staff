## Get Started/MISC

- Please read this and `#readme`
- Tag yourself with relevant roles if someone else hasn't already (e.g. `readme-dev`, `Caster`, `Rustaff`, etc). 
- Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/Jtkdcc" target="_blank">staff backup server</a>. 
- The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GlVQ0fVPDKt0qnJJ4chqGBrrsmhkkZ1YqUxleVcYusg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">qihl Backend Sheet</a> shows Staff Teams and leads, the complete Staff List, Staff Applications, Server Growth, tournament info, and other useful stuff. Do not share the link. 
- If you're doing something other than moderating, get on the <a href="https://trello.com/invite/qihl1/0170a55acbb1a742c185aae0010783ae" target="_blank">qihl Trello board</a> so you know what your team is working on. If you're a dev, everything should be in the gitlab repo.  
- Do not `@staff`, `@moderators`, or similar unless there is a serious reason to do so (staff lobbies, minor player reports, memes, etc are NOT sufficient). 
- Gold count at the end of a game is basically meaningless to humans as it adds from selling units but does not subtract from buying them. 
- Enable developer mode in Discord settings under Appearence to right-click people and get their Discord ID. Then you can create `@`'s yourself (e.g. `<@93049613392568320>`).

## Player Reports

Only those with Staff 2 role have banning rights. If you are Staff, ask a Staff 2 to ban a user for you. Permaban is on the table for multiple offenses, but is evaluated case-by-case. 

### Under Ranked

- 1 rank under: Light Warning
- 2 rank under: Light Warning
- 3 rank under: Use best judgment. Strong Warning or ban based on the circumstances. If ban, unban if they apologize.
- 4 rank under: Use best judgment. Strong Warning or ban based on the circumstances. If ban, unban if they apologize.
- 5+ ranks under: 7 day ban minimum.

### Password Sharing

Password sharing or inviting friends is often just ignorance to the rules. Most of these are a case-by-case basis.
- If you've decided they were just ignorant: Give a strong warning and a threat of ban if it happens in the future.
- If you've decided they were actively trying to get around the rules of the server: 7 day ban minimum.
- Ignore if the bot is down.

If you're unsure, judge based on the rank of the invited player relative to the rest of the lobby. (See Under Ranked rules)

### Cheating

Make sure, beyond reasonable doubt, they were cheating. Consult with other staff if needed. `!blacklist [steamid] [reason]` if they are found guilty. Never unban (`!unblacklist [steamid]`) unless they can PROVE their innocence.

### Spam

If they had a clear intent to flood the server, beyond reasonable doubt, manual Ban to delete their messages with spam as the reason given. If they apologize, unban.

### Racism, Hate Speech, and Personal Attacks

If it was beyond regular flaming and insults, 7 day minimum ban.

## Helping in `#help-desk`

- Telling them to read `#readme` is often the best solution. Maybe mention the specific part. 
- If someone is having trouble linking, ask them to make sure they are using the correct Discord/Steam in browser. Maybe tell them to clear their browser cache and try again. 
- If bot says a new persons rank is `error` check if they have a rank in game. If not, give them the beginner role or tell them to play a few more games until they get a rank. 
- If bot says someone someones Steam is already linked to another Discord account, ask them to get on that Discord account and post in `#help-desk`. It's not a huge deal if they can't, but it's preferable. Check if they've been banned. If not, `!adminunlinksteam [steamid]` to unlink from the other Discord account. 
- Lobbies auto-close after 15 minutes of no activity, 5 minutes of no activity when full, 60 minutes no matter what, or 10 join/leaves.
